python: Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in the development of web applications. It is easy to learn, has a large and active community, and is supported by a wealth of libraries and frameworks.

git : One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users. Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase.
